<h3 id="the-doing">The Doing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Wrote a Python script to convert json objects to user-specified-character delimited things. Needed it so I could grab fieldnames out of metadata</li>
<li>More familiar with bash, scripting, Linux environment</li>
<li>Did some things with git beyond yeh nasic boy commands - push, pull, add, commit - and succesfully messed around with rebase, ammend, and hooks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-learning">The Learning</h3>
<ul>
<li>Will get rid of this section unless I&rsquo;m doing theoretical learnings, right now learning is doing so this is redundant</li>
<li>Theoretical things for the future:
<ul>
<li>Compiler(build one)</li>
<li>Database Systems</li>
<li>Algorithms(this is sadly STILL not in my wheelhouse, hopefully in a few months once the new job has become old hat)</li>
<li>Type Theory</li>
<li>Complexity Theory</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After seeing the above people be wondering what I <strong>DO</strong> know.</p>
