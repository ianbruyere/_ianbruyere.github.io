          <p>My coding endeavors are in a state of drift: whatever grabs my attention for a brief burst before I turn to the next shiny thing. I take it as my natural bounty of finally being employed: enjoying coding instead of a method of &ldquo;getting employed&rdquo;; every time I sat down to code in my unemployed state I&rsquo;d be pursuing:<br>
<strong>A)</strong> enticing employers with my knowledge of buzz words<br>
<strong>B)</strong> shoring up theoretical weaknesses given my lack of &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; education <em>i.e.</em> no CS degree<br>
<strong>C)</strong> working on/presenting evidence of A &amp; B via github commits.<br>
I learned much within these pursuits—though C could&rsquo;ve been better—but it makes this aimless period necessary, and I need to not feel guilty about it!</p>
<h3 id="the-doing">The Doing</h3>
<p>Writing documentation. Work-related. I&rsquo;ve taken it upon myself to write an onboarding document. Something sorely needed and that no one is interested/has the time to do. Also looked at gym.openai.com after talking with a friend. Seems fun.</p>
<h3 id="the-learning">The Learning</h3>
<p>Not too much here. Mainly practical stuff lately. Got the hang of awk. Need to learn more about sed and than chaining the two into the powerful amlagamation they are supposed to be, with grep being the unnmentioned but always present shadow god.</p>
<h3 id="the-future">The Future</h3>
<p>As I said, I&rsquo;m in drift. At some point I&rsquo;ll get to my main project: which needs more test cases, a frontend, and for me to write about all the work I&rsquo;ve put into it, all the work that it needs going forward, and all the wonderful things it&rsquo;s going to teach me. But first&hellip;.</p>
