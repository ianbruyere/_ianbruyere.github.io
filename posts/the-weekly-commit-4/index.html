          <p>I currently sit within a coding state akin to genetic drift: floating on the wings of whatever grabsmy attention for whatever brief burst of joy before I turn to the next shiny thing. I take it as my natural bounty of finally being employed: enjoying that coding is a fun thing instead of a means to &ldquo;getting employed&rdquo;. This meant every time I sat down to code in my unemployed state I should be pursuing such goals as:
\n**A)<strong>enticing employers with my knowledge of buzz words
\n</strong>B)<strong>shoring up theoretical weaknesses given my lack of &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; education <em>i.e.</em> no CS degree
\n</strong>C)**working on/presenting evidence of a &amp; b via github commits.
\nI learned much given these narrow confinesU+2014;though pursit C could&rsquo;ve been betterU+2014but it makes me savor these weeks of drift all the more.</p>
<h3 id="the-doing">The Doing</h3>
<p>Writing documentation. Work-related. I&rsquo;ve taken it upon myself to write an onboarding document. Something sorely needed and that no one is interested/has the time to do. Also looked at gym.openai.com after talking with a friend. Seems fun.</p>
<h3 id="the-learning">The Learning</h3>
<p>Not too much here. Mainly practical stuff lately. Got the hang of awk. Need to learn more about sed and than chaining the two into the powerful amlagamation they are supposed to be, with grep being the unnmentioned but always present shadow god.</p>
<h3 id="the-future">The Future</h3>
<p>As I said, I&rsquo;m in drift. At some point I&rsquo;ll get to my main project, which needs more test cases, and also a frontend, and also for me to write about what it is and why I&rsquo;m excited for it. Once I start to feel some selection pressures&hellip;</p>
