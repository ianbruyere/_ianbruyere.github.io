      <description>The Doing I wrote some bash scripts: one that uses sed/awk to find null data giving the option to scrub it, and another that goes through a series of logs and outputs the desired information to console.
Learning Learning what I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing: awk/sed/grep and bash scripting, the fine art of using and analyzing the tools.
Near Future Goals Haven&amp;rsquo;t exactly been knocking any of these off my to-do lists. Happy with the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m making self-started endeavors to code a bit every week(outside of work) but haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to focus on any of my major goals.</description>

      <description>The Doing Not too much doing. The crush of Christmas and New Years being what it is. Mainly finding the threads of where I left off in my own code. Mainly in the testing section, simply need to remember where I was questing.
Learning Did some brief overview of security stuff. Mainly laying down some lead lines for future(far off) endeavors. Nothing much.
Near-Future Goals About the same. Start on my project in earnest as time and sanity allows, also keep up with my own small projects as buffers against code-block and staleness.</description>

      <description>The Doing Made a CLI in python to process some Personal Training Data. It&amp;rsquo;s standard as dataprocessing goes: input a csv, clean it, outputs interesting information in csv. Other than being practically useful for myself, it allowed me to scrape the rust off my Python. The Python Standard Library is vast, and my goal of having it close at hand is only possible through constant practice. Suddenly having full-time work day disrupted my rhythm; doing some personal coding is a sign I haven&amp;rsquo;t lost the beat.</description>
